Problem 3 — AI-Based Smart auto focus &amp; Dynamic Subject Tracking System<br><br>

Design and implement an AI-powered system that allows a user to select any subject (e.g., a
player or object) in a video (.mp4 or live stream) and automatically maintain focus on it.<br>
<br>
The system must:<br>
<br>
● Detect the selected object when the user taps/clicks on it.<br>
● Continuously track the selected subject across frames.<br>
● Keep the selected subject sharp and highlighted.<br>
● Apply background blur to all other objects.<br>
● Instantly switch focus if the user clicks on a different object.<br>
● Handle fast motion, multiple subjects, occlusion, and low-light conditions.<br>
● Run on-device (Android / iOS / Web), any one of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Expected Output / Deliverables<br>
<br>
<br>
Participants must provide:<br>
<br>
● A working application that processes video input (recorded or live).<br>
● Real-time subject tracking with dynamic focus switching.<br>
● Visual output showing the selected subject in focus while others are blurred.<br>
● A brief explanation of the approach (e.g., detection + tracking + segmentation
  pipeline).
